# üìÉOpen API Specification For Rage

OasRage is a tool for generating **automatic interactive documentation for your Rage APIs**. It generates an **OAS 3.1** document and displays it using **[RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com)**.

Built for the high-performance [Rage](https://github.com/rage-rb/rage) framework, OasRage leverages Rage's compatibility with Rails and its modern Ruby features, including fiber scheduling for non-blocking I/O. It relies on the [OasCore](https://github.com/a-chacon/oas_core) gem for seamless OpenAPI integration.
